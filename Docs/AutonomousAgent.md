A steering behavior is a component that moves the object away or towards a certain point.

- Seek: the object moves directly towards a point
- Flee: the object moves directly away from a point
- Arrive: the object moves directly towards a point, but slows down before reaching the point.

- Pursuit: the object moves to intercept a moving object.
- Evade: the object moves to evade a moving object.
