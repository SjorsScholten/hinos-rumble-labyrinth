# Crafting

The player can craft items using resources and materials.

Resources define the cost to craft the item.

Materials will define the attributes the crafted item will have.

To craft a type of item the player will need a recipe and crafting kit.

## Recipes
The recipe will decide what kind of item is made, i.e. a weapon or potion. Recipes can be found in multiple places. Some can be bought from the shop, others are quest related items, some can be found in the labyrinth.

## Crafting Kits
The crafting kit is a requirement to be able to make the recipe and to create higher level items with higher level materials.

> â„¹ - Crafting kits can be replaced by confidants, raising the confidant level will allow the player to craft better items, similar to upgrading the crafting kit.
