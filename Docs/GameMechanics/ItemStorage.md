# Item Storage

There are two types of storage for items. The player has a small item storage that can store a limited amount of items. And the playes home base has a storage that holds a large amount of items.

## Inventory

The player has an inventory he can use to store the items he finds in the labyrinths. The inventory has limited slots, forcing the player to think about what he should bring on his expedition.

Through upgrading the inventory, the player can increase the amount of slots it has. In order to upgrade the player might need to fulfill a condition (cost, material, or level).

> Does the player have separate groups of slots for armor, weapon, and materials (like in BOTW). So, the player will have different upgrades, extending the progression loop and adding a choice for the player.

## Storage

Base storage is a larger item container that the player can use to store items for safekeeping. The player can only access the base storage from the home base.

The storage is a part of the guild. The player can upgrade the size of the storage.

## Lose Item Penalty

When the player dies in the labyrinth, some or all items in the player storage will be lost. Giving the player a reason to think about whether it would be worth it to bring an item, but have a chance to lose it.

From the list of items that will be lost, the player can choose a number of items he wants to keep.

When the player progresses through the game he can eventually choose more items he wants to keep.

Key-items cannot be lost.

Items can have an effect which keeps them from becoming lost.

## Lost Items

Lost items have a chance to appear in the lost item shop. When an item appears in the lost item shop the player will have a limited time to buy the item back.
