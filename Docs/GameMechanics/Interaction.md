# Interaction Mechanics

The player can start different processes by interacting with objects. Examples of processes that can occur can be: Inspect an object, Open a loot container, or start a dialog.

Every object that can be interacted with is highlighted by a white upside-down triangle above the object. Above the object there will be an icon indicating what kind of action will occur when the player interacts with it.

A dialog action is represented by a text cloud.
An inspect action is represented by a magnifying glass.

- Get the interactable from the scene
- call the interaction action on the object
