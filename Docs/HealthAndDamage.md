# Health and Damage

Every living entity has a value representing its health.
The amount of health is determined by the character's vitality stat.

When the character takes damage, the damage is subtracted from the health value.
Before damage is applied, the damage will be modified by the characters resistances, defense, and damage multipliers.

defense is determined by the armor of the character and any effects applied to the character.



* It would be nice to move away from abstract stat values like a 99 or 250 value in stat similar in persona or pokemon. It is unclear what this means for the player. 

Vitality can directly mean the amount of health the character has. The same can be done for other direct stats like skill-points or stamina.

It becomes difficult for attributes like speed, reaction, talent, etc. these stats benefit for a more abstract value because they can affect a lot more properties.
