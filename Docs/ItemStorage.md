# Item Storage

There are two types of storage for items. The player has a small item storage that can store a limited amount of items. And the playes home base has a storage that holds a large amount of items.

## Player storage

Player storage is a small item container that the player can use to store the items he finds in the dungeons. It has a limited space which can be upgraded over the course of the game.

The limited space in the inventory will keep the player thinking of what he can bring to use in the labyrinth and what he can take back home.

When the player dies in the labyrinth, some or all items in the player storage will be lost. Giving the player a reason to think about whether it would be worth it to take an item and maybe lose it.

## Home storage

Base storage is a larger item container that the player can use to store items for safekeeping. The player can only access the base storage from the home base.

## Interactivity

- The player can move items between storage spaces.
- Items the player finds in the dungeon are added to the player storage.
